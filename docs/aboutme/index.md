# About me

Hi üëãüèª, I'm Alex. A software developer, engineer and tech enthusiast from the Netherlands.

I was born as in the beginning of 1989. I was born with hereditary [ocular albinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_albinism), which makes me visually impaired. However I am a curious person and ever since I was a child I wanted to learn about everything and anything. I started my computing journey at the age of 4 with an [Olivetti PC1](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=182). It came with MS-DOS on floppy and it didn't even have internal storage.

A couple of years later my parents bought a beige 386 with [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x). This ignited my curiosity and the next steps in my computing journey. Having internal storage was great and I soon started exploring Windows. Games were my primary passion, but even back than I knew I wanted to be a software developer.

At the age of 9 my parents again updated our family computer to a [Cyrix 200Mhz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix_6x86) and 32MB RAM. Now with [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98) and a 28k modem. I soon discovered the internet and that really ignited my passion for computers. At this time I also discovered how to create websites and I soon started pouring hours into hand crafting HTML in Windows Notepad.

In secondary school we also got broadband at home. And there was even more exposure to computing in general. At this time I also started out with designer tools such as [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [Adobe Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop). However after secondary school I went to [Avans University of Applied Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avans_University_of_Applied_Sciences) and got my bachelors degree in IT. Even after all those years since, I still wanted to be a software engineer.

Today I still really enjoy building software. I love the freedom and empowerment it provides me. I also spent a lot of time setting up and maintaining my own homelab. Finally I consider myself an experienced [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) enthusiast.

Thank you for reading this and being awesome!
